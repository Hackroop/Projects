# Comprehensive Network Infrastructure Development for SMB (Small/Med Business): A Multifaceted Approach

## Duration
* July 2023 - August 2023

## Association
* [Divergence Academy](https://www.divergenceacademy.com/)

## Project Summary

Working as part of a collaborative team, we developed a comprehensive SMB network infrastructure, leveraging a wide range of technical tools and operating systems.

Our robust solution incorporated a fully integrated LAN, DMZ, and guest network. We predominantly utilized [GNS3](https://www.gns3.com/) for network simulation and design, with our team members proficiently using the Windows command line and [PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/) to contribute to the creation of a seamless Windows domain environment.

Exemplifying our collective server management capabilities, we facilitated the deployment of an [IIS webserver](https://www.iis.net/) and a secure Windows FTP server. We extensively utilized tools such as [PuTTY](https://www.putty.org/) and [SSH](https://www.ssh.com/ssh/) for remote server communication and management.

We also successfully set up a fully functional [Windows 10 workstation](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/get-windows-10), by expertly navigating the Windows OS, showcasing our team's skill set.

In our effort to establish a [LAMP webserver](https://www.linux.com/training-tutorials/how-create-network-lamp-stack/) on Ubuntu, which hosted an interactive wiki, our team effectively utilized the Linux command line, demonstrating our ability with Linux-based systems and Apache, MySQL, and PHP.

We paid particular attention to security, a critical aspect of our project, by designing and establishing a robust [FortiGate firewall](https://www.fortinet.com/products/next-generation-firewall) with a VIP for a DMZ webserver. Our team's familiarity with the FortiGate platform was instrumental in this accomplishment.

Throughout this project, our team proved its adaptability by proficiently using both Windows and [Mac OS](https://www.apple.com/macos/monterey/) platforms. This endeavor stands as a testament to our ability to synergize various technical tools and systems to create a comprehensive network solution.
